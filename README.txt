Contract Structure: Giveaway

    This contract allows users to donate funds to a common pool, track their donations through coupons, and randomly choose a winner who can claim the total donated amount.

State Variables

    owner: Stores the address of the contract creator. Only the owner can assign a winner.
    totalDonations: Accumulates the total Ether donated to the contract.
    couponCount: Counts the total number of coupons issued.
    coupons: A mapping that tracks the number of coupons each address holds (each coupon represents a donation).
    couponOwners: Maps each coupon's unique ID to the address that owns it.
    isWinner: A mapping that flags an address as the winner, allowing it to claim the funds.
    giveawayClosed: A boolean to track if the giveaway has concluded.

Events

    DonationReceived: Emitted when a donation is received, recording the donor's address, amount, and assigned coupon ID.
    WinnerAssigned: Emitted when a winner is selected.
    EtherClaimed: Emitted when the winner claims the Ether from the pool.

Modifiers

    onlyOwner: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute certain functions.
    onlyWinner: Allows only the winner (who hasn't already claimed) to call certain functions.
    whenGiveawayOpen: Ensures that functions can only execute while the giveaway is open.

Constructor

    constructor(): Sets the owner of the contract to the address deploying the contract.

Functions

    donate():
        Allows users to donate Ether to the giveaway while it's open.
        Requires a non-zero donation.
        Increases totalDonations, increments couponCount, and adds a coupon to the donor’s account.
        Emits DonationReceived.

    assignWinner(address _winner):
        Restricted to the owner and can only be called while the giveaway is open.
        Sets the specified _winner address as the winner, closes the giveaway, and emits WinnerAssigned.

    claim():
        Allows the winner to claim the total donated Ether.
        Ensures totalDonations is greater than zero and prevents reentrancy attacks by resetting state before transferring funds.
        Sends Ether to the winner’s address and emits EtherClaimed.

    getCouponCount(address _donor):
        Returns the number of coupons held by a specified _donor.

    getPoolBalance():
        Returns the current balance of the contract, representing the pool of funds.

    receive():
        Special function to receive Ether directly (e.g., if someone sends Ether to the contract without calling donate).
        Increments donation and coupon counts, records the donation, and emits DonationReceived.

Security Considerations

    Reentrancy protection: In the claim() function, the totalDonations and isWinner state variables are reset before transferring funds to prevent reentrancy attacks.

Workflow Summary

    Donations: Users donate Ether, which the contract records by issuing coupons.
    Winner Assignment: The owner assigns a winner after collecting donations.
    Prize Claim: The winner claims the accumulated Ether in the contract.
